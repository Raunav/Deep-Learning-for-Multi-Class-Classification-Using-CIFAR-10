# Deep-Learning-for-Multi-Class-Classification-Using-CIFAR-10
This project involves designing and implementing multiple Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different categories.
The objective was to evaluate and fine-tune hyperparameters, including the number of layers, activation functions, and optimizers, to achieve better performance than a baseline model.

Project Overview
Dataset
The CIFAR10 dataset consists of:

50,000 training images (32x32 color images)
10,000 testing images
10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
For more details about the dataset, visit the CIFAR10 documentation.

Objective
The objective is to:

Build a baseline DNN model for image classification.
Design and fine-tune two additional DNN models with optimized hyperparameters for better performance.
Tools and Libraries
Python
Keras
TensorFlow
Models
Baseline Model: A simple DNN with a few layers and basic hyperparameters.
Fine-tuned Model 1: Optimized number of layers, neurons, and activation functions.
Fine-tuned Model 2: Adjusted optimizer and other hyperparameters for improved performance.
Metrics
Accuracy: The number of correctly classified images divided by the total number of images.
Key Features
Baseline Performance: Evaluate initial results.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Experiment with layers, neurons, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.
Comparison: Compare the accuracy of baseline and fine-tuned models.
Results
The performance of the three models is reported in terms of accuracy on the testing set. Please refer to the accompanying documentation and code comments for a detailed explanation.
